### __Keep children on track academically__

Parents may be worried that their children will fall behind academically if they miss class. It is likely that your school will provide homework or online learning for students while schools are closed. Some schools may already have software they are using for online learning such as [Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/products/classroom/?modal_active=none). Be sure to ask your school what plan they have in place for remote learning while schools have closed. 

Even if your school does not have a plan in place, there is a lot of great support available for keeping children on track academically. The online learning movement has been active for over a decade and many, free superb tools exist to help children stay on track academically with zero parent involvement. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is a superb, free tool for online learning __for grades K-12__ that is aligned with state standards and common core, can track your child’s progress, and personalize learning according to your child’s strengths and weaknesses.
