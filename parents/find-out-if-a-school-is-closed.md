## __Find out if a school is closed__

In order to determine if a school is closed, visit the school district’s website or contact the district. Also, make sure your district has up-to-date contact information so that you don’t miss important online communication.  The CDC advises parents to be sure to ask their children’s schools about their plans for school dismissals or school closures.
